    <p>(((this website is by Billy. I didnt make the games i just put the first 3 into githack from github, the jstris is from the jstris website that i changed slightly and put on my own website, and the slither.io port is from griffpatch and i just changed some textures. I do not take credit for any of these games n stuff.)))</p>
