    <p style="color:white">(((this website is by Billy. I didnt make the games i just took the first 2 from github, the third from superhot, the jstris is from the jstris website that i changed slightly and put on my own website, the slither.io port is from griffpatch and i just changed some textures, and friday night funkin is literally just a redirect to someone elses website. I do not take credit for any of these games n stuff.)))</p>
