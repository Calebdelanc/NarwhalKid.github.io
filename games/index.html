    <p style="color:white">(((this website is by Billy. I didnt make the games i just took the first 2 from github, the third from superhot, the jstris is from the jstris website that i changed slightly and put on my own website, the slither.io is from griffpatch and i just changed some textures, the tanuki sunset and baldis basics are from shsgames, and friday night funkin, krunker, skribbl, and gartic are literally just a redirects to someone elses website. I do not take credit for any of these games n stuff.)))</p>
